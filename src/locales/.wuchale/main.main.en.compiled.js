It has always been an important part of my life,\nyet I have never fully committed to playing it. I was motivated during high school, but the\npandemic put a sudden stop to that. During my first years at university, I played the guitar\noccasionally and suddenly felt the urge to buy all kinds of musical instruments. To this day,\nI still don't know how to play most of them. I hope that the music theory lessons I am taking\nnow will provide me with a foundation that will make me feel more confident with any\ninstrument — at least I won't be completely lost. I cannot imagine my life without an\ninstrument or music in the background. With Flux Studio, I hope to combine my hobby with my\nwork by providing a tool for anyone to play and learn music. Perhaps one day I will be able to\ncompose pieces too! I'm not sure whether to add a music theory section to this website with\nthe tips and tricks that I learn or find, since there are already plenty of good online\nresources, and I don't want to create something substandard that might contain incorrect\ninformation.","Computer Science",["I discovered programming in my first year at university, studying Python and C. I found the\nfirst Python course terrible, but loved the C one. I therefore took the computer science\ncourse at my university for my second and third years of my bachelor's degree. I completed two\ninternships during this time, which broadened my horizons, particularly the second one, which\nwas in a laboratory. I will write an article about it later, as it was really interesting. To\ngive you a brief overview, my team needed to create autonomous, dynamic mesh networks for use\nby firefighters in isolated areas without an Internet connection. As you might have guessed, I\nspecialised in networks for my master's degree and successfully completed the first year. I\ncannot say which aspect interests me the most, but I find the whole field fascinating. I plan\nto make the most of my year off by studying ",[0,"MIT open courses"]," and scientific papers in other fields, such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence."],"On the subject of artificial intelligence, I admit that I use it myself sometimes. I have a\nmixed view of it: it might be useful for saving time, but it is counterproductive in a\nlearning context because you don't put much thought into your work. That is mainly why I avoid\nusing it too much. On this website, for instance, I encountered some issues with SvelteKit's\nbehaviour when routing pages, so I used Anthropic's Claude chatbot to gain insight into the\nsituation and resolved it myself. AI doesn't create the project, but it certainly saves me\ntime on research when I hit a wall. The environmental impact in terms of energy and pollution\nshould also be considered seriously, in my opinion. I also avoid using too much AI for this\nreason.","Curriculum Vitæ","Open my CV","Home","Articles","Contact","Projects","Work In Progress","Search...","Search","Filters","Select the filters you want to use for your research.","Sort By","Select a sorting order","You can choose how the results are sorted with this filter.","Featured","You can choose if you want to search for featured articles or not.","Posted After","Pick a date","You can filter all articles posted after this date.","Posted Before","You can filter all articles posted before this date.","Categories","Select the tags","You can filter the resulting articles based on their tags (the articles will match all\ntags).","Apply","Previous","Next","Contact Form",["In addition to the social media links at the bottom of every page, you can use this contact form\nto get in touch with me directly.

My goals are ambitious, but I will do my best to see this project\nthrough. As you may have guessed, music is my passion, and I want it to be a central element of\nmy life, whether through playing music or developing this software."],["This is also an opportunity for me to learn Rust, which seems like a really promising\nprogramming language. You can find out more at ",[0,"their website"]," directly for more details, but it might just become my go-to language for almost every use cases.\nDespite the fact that the Rust community is relatively new, the Rustaceans (the name of the Rust\ndevelopers' community) are very active, and the available resources are constantly growing. There\nis even debate about whether this language should be included in the Linux Kernel. I will leave you\nto do your own research on this subject, as this is not the main topic of this page."],"The content of this page is bound to change as the project progresses.","Main goals","My first goal is to successfully process and generate live audio signals. I want to be able to\nmanipulate the gain and recognise or decompose the frequencies within the signal. The next\nstep would be to add a graphical user interface (GUI) for manipulating the signals. I think\nthe GUI will be the most challenging aspect of this project. As you may have gathered from\nthis website, UI/UX design is not my forte. However, I don't plan on creating a substandard\nGUI, even if it takes me a long time to refine it. I am still thinking about the next steps in\nthis project. I have lots of ideas, but I don't yet know the intermediate steps, and I need to\nbe realistic about which features I can actually implement.","Expected difficulties","As I have never used Rust before, it is difficult for me to anticipate the issues I will\nencounter on this project. However, I think the main issues will stem from the relatively new\nRust ecosystem, since many of its crates are not yet mature. For example, there is no\nconsensus on which crate to use for creating graphical interfaces for applications. Many\ndifferent projects are being developed to meet the needs of the community, each with their own\nparticular features, but none of them are particularly notable. I need to do a lot of research\nfor this, and I will probably publish an article about my findings.","The second obstacle that I fear the most is developing a cross-platform application. From the\noutset, I intend to develop Flux Studio with modular code to simplify the management of the\nvarious crates required for each operating system. However, I am still anxious about the\nmoment when I attempt to optimise the application. I have no experience of cross-platform\ndevelopment so far, so my worries may be unfounded.","Roadmap",["This website is my way of justifying taking a year off from university. If you're not sure what\nI mean, you can find out more on ",[0,"this page"],". It is\nalso a way for me to keep track of my activities, projects, and associated goals. I think it\ncould be useful for business partners or recruiters who want to find out more about a candidate\nbefore making an offer. If you are interested in this, I am definitely the person for the job -\ndon't hesitate to contact me! More seriously, I will develop this website in my free time to\npromote myself and my projects."],"Svelte and SvelteKit",["I was curious about learning how to use a web development framework, so this is also the\nperfect opportunity to make something with the ones I had in mind: Svelte and SvelteKit. I've\nheard a lot of good things about them, so I thought I'd give them a try, and I have to say, I\nwas impressed. Even though I didn't have much experience with Javascript or HTML/CSS, they\nmade it really easy to build something decent. I'll probably write an article about it later,\nwhen I'm a bit more experienced and confident in explaining things, but I encourage you to\ncheck ",[0,"their website"]," for more details."],"Main Milestones","My first goal is to create a fully functional application comprising all its pages, error\nhandling and efficient back-end logic. Then, I will try to make the entire application\nresponsive. Finally, I will add quality-of-life features such as multiple language support and\na more efficient UI. Once all of this has been achieved, I will update the style periodically\n(perhaps with seasonal themes) and add content in the form of articles and projects. I\nenvision the articles feature as interactive: the main point is to share my knowledge and\nexperiences and showcase my hobbies, but most importantly, to learn from your feedback and\nconstantly improve.",[[0],"Written on ",0],[[0],"Modified on ",0],"Close","More pages","Go to next page","Go to previous page","Toggle Sidebar","Sidebar","Displays the mobile sidebar.",["First of all, my name is Matthieu Dartois and I am a ",0,"-year-old French student in\nParis.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question."],"I suppose I should talk about myself a bit, since that's kind of the goal of this page.\nHowever, I don't want to seem pretentious, and I'm not comfortable with exposing too much of\nmyself. So, I'll be brief and get straight to the point. I am passionate about music and\ncomputer science, but a lack of free time during my Master's degree meant that I couldn't play\nmusic or do anything else. This had a negative impact on me, and I felt a little regretful,\nlost and depressed about not achieving anything. That is why I decided to take a year off from\nuniversity. I joined a music organisation to take violin lessons, and I study computer science\nin my remaining free time. My first goal is to complete this website/portfolio before moving\non to the main topic: Flux Studio. The name may be temporary, but it represents what I want to\nachieve: a smooth, versatile tool for playing music. This is a way for me to combine both\nworlds during my year off and explore lots of different tools and subjects that I wouldn't\nencounter in my classes. I will use the articles to share my achievements, the problems I\nencounter, and the knowledge I have acquired, hoping that you will learn something from them\nand/or get your feedback to help me learn more.","Incorrect range with the selected dates.
